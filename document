My research interests include Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning. Previously, I was broadly interested in several research topics including document summarization, text generation, sentiment analysis, semantic parsing, multilingual and multimodal NLP. Recently, I am interested in exploring NLG evaluation, faithfulness and safety of LLMs, and cross-modal generation.
